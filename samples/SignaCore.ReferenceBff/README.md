# SignaCore Reference BFF

A minimal reference Browser-for-Frontend (BFF) that signs administrators in to a SignaCore
server through Authorization Code + PKCE (S256), keeps every token in a server-side session, and
exposes only an opaque local cookie to the browser.

The sample resolves the authorization, token, JWKS, and UserInfo endpoints from the Authority's
OpenID Connect Discovery document. Nothing is hardcoded.

> **Single-instance reference.** The session ticket store is in-process memory: a restart loses
> sessions and replicas do not share them. Replace it with a shared store before running more
> than one instance. First-administrator binding and coordinated upstream logout are delivered by
> later SignaCore tasks.

## Configuration

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ReferenceBff:Authority` | SignaCore base address (HTTPS) |
| `ReferenceBff:ClientId` | Client id registered in SignaCore |
| `ReferenceBff:ClientSecret` | Client secret — inject through the environment or user secrets |
| `ReferenceBff:RedirectUri` | This host's HTTPS redirect URI (default path `/signin-oidc`) |
| `ReferenceBff:Scope` | Requested scope (must contain `openid`) |

The configuration is validated at startup; an incomplete configuration fails to start.

Register the redirect URI on the SignaCore application (interactive OIDC configuration) with the
code flow enabled before using the sample.

## Run

```bash
SIGNACORE_REFERENCE_BFF_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
dotnet run --project samples/SignaCore.ReferenceBff \
  --ReferenceBff:Authority=https://your-signacore-host \
  --ReferenceBff:ClientId=reference-bff \
  --ReferenceBff:RedirectUri=https://your-bff-host/signin-oidc
```

Then open `https://your-bff-host/` and follow **Sign in with SignaCore**.

## Security shape

- SignaCore credentials never pass through this BFF: the browser is redirected to SignaCore's
  authorization endpoint, and the password is posted directly to SignaCore's own login form.
- Every login uses a fresh `state`, `nonce`, and PKCE verifier; the correlation cookie is
  `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=None` for the top-level redirect back.
- The ID token is validated for `iss`, signature (via JWKS), `exp`/`iat`, `nonce`, and `aud`
  (the client id). A failure of any of them fails the sign-in; no local session is established.
- A missing or mismatching `state` or correlation cookie fails the callback before any token
  exchange.
- Tokens are saved into a server-side ticket store (`ITicketStore`); the browser receives only
  the opaque `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` session key cookie. No token material is
  stored in the browser, rendered into HTML, or placed in a URL.
- The access token is used only on the server-to-server `GET /bff/me` call to SignaCore's
  Discovery-resolved UserInfo endpoint. A UserInfo `401` (the upstream identity session is gone)
  revokes the local session and answers the bounded error page — the BFF never keeps a
  signed-in appearance over a dead upstream session.
- The only state-changing browser surface is `POST /bff/logout`, protected by antiforgery; it
  clears the local cookie and the server-side ticket. There is no GET logout.
- Expired tickets are reclaimed both when presented and by a periodic background sweep.

## Scope

This is a sample consumer of SignaCore, not a product. The ticket store is single-instance
memory, coordinated upstream logout and first-administrator binding are out of scope, and
deployment hardening beyond the boundaries above is intentionally left out.
